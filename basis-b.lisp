; We generate from prefix a legal variable symbol in the same package as

; symbol with symbol-name prefix first and otherwise suffix prefix with
; increasingly large naturals (starting from 0) to find a suitable variable.
; If n is non-nil it had better be a natural and we immediately begin trying
; suffixes from there.  Since no legal variable begins with #\* or #\&, we tack
; a #\V on the front of our prefix if prefix starts with one of those chars.
; If prefix is empty, we use "V".

; Note: This system will eventually contain a lot of code to generate

; We cannot just "forward" the arguments of defstub to encapsulate and have
; encapsulate validate them, for two reasons.  First, the new-style syntax
; differs slightly in the two macros (e.g. (defstub f (*) => *) vs.
; (encapsulate (((f *) => *)) ...)) while the old-style syntax is the same
; (e.g. (defstub f (x) t) vs. (encapsulate ((f (x) t)) ...)), making it
; necessary to distinguish new style from old style to adapt slightly the
; syntax in the new style prior to passing the arguments to encapsulate.
; Second, the witness to pass to the encapsulate is constructed differently
; depending on whether the style is new or old.

; Here we are content to perform only a few validation checks, which at least
; suffice to let us pass the right data to encapsulate, which performs all
; remaining validation checks.

; In both styles, there must be at least two arguments following the name.  If
; this condition fails, it would not be clear what to pass to encapsulate.

; after the name: if there is no third argument, we must be in the old style,
; because the new style requires inputs, arrow, and outputs; if the third
; argument is a keyword, we must be in the old style, because the output part
; of the new style cannot be a keyword; if the third argument is not a keyword,

; Essay on Abbreviating Live Stobjs

; Right now the live state is abbreviated as <state> when it is printed, and
; the user's live stobj $s is abbreviated as <$s>.  It would be cool if the
; user could specify how he or she wants a stobj displayed, e.g., by selecting
; key components for printing or by providing a function which maps the stobj
; to some non-stobj ``stand-in'' or eviscerated object for printing.

; I have given this matter several hours' thought and abandoned it for the
; moment.  I am not convinced it is worth the trouble.  It IS a lot of trouble.

; We eviscerate stobjs in the read-eval-print loop.  (Through Version_4.3, we
; also eviscerated stobjs in a very low-level place: ev-fncall-msg (and its
; more pervasive friend, ev-fncall-guard-er), used to print stobjs involved in
; calls of functions on args that violate a guard.)

; Every stobj must have some ``stand-in transformer'' function, fn.  We will
; typically be holding a stobj name, e.g., $S, and a live value, val, e.g.,
; (#(777) #(1 2 3 ...)), and wish to obtain some ACL2 object to print in place
; of the value.  This value is obtained by applying fn to val.  The two main
; issues I see are

; (a) where do we find fn?  The candidate places are state, world, and val
; itself.  But we do not have state available in the low-level code.

; (b) how do we apply fn to val?  The obvious thing is to call trans-eval or do
; an ev-fncall.  Again, we need state.  Furthermore, depending on how we do it,
; we have to fight a syntactic battle of ``casting'' an arbitrary object, val,
; to a stobj of type name, to apply a function which has a STOBJS-IN of (name).
; A more important problem is the one of order-of-definition.  Which is defined
; first: how to eviscerate a stobj or how to evaluate a form?  Stobj
; evisceration calls evaluation to apply fn, but evaluation calls stobj
; evisceration to report guard errors.

; Is user-specified stobj abbreviation really worth the trouble?

; One idea that presents itself is that val ``knows how to abbreviate itself.''
; I think this is akin to the idea of having a :program mode function, say
; stobj-standin, which syntactically takes a non-stobj and returns a non-stobj.
; Actually, stobj-standin would be called on val.  It is clear that I could
; define this function in raw lisp: look in *the-live-state* to determine how
; to abbreviate val and then just do it.  But what would be the logical
; definition of it?  We could leave it undefined, or defined to be an undefined
; function.  Until we admit the whole ACL2 system :logically, we could even
; define it in the logic to be t even though it really returned something else,
; since as a :program its logical definition is irrelevant.  But at the moment
; I don't think ACL2 has a precedent for such a function and I don't think
; user-specified stobj abbreviation is justification enough for doing it.

  (check-sum1 0 *1-check-length-exclusive-maximum* channel state))

; We now develop code for computing checksums of objects.  For many versions
; through Version_8.5 there were two separate algorithms, culminating
; respectively in functions named old-check-sum-obj, which has since been
; removed from the sources, and fchecksum-obj.  The first development was used
; up through ACL2 Version_3.4, which used an algorithm similar to that of our
; file-based function, check-sum.  However, ACL2 (with hons) was being used on
; large cons trees with significant subtree sharing.  These "galactic" trees
; could have relatively few distinct cons cells but a huge naive node count.
; It was thus desirable to memoize the computation of checksums, which was
; impossible using the existing algorithm because it modified state.

; The second development was contributed by Jared Davis (and is now maintained
; by the ACL2 developers, who are responsible for any errors).  It is amenable
; to memoization and, indeed, fchecksum-obj is memoized.  We say more after
; developing the code for the first algorithm, culminating in function
; check-sum-obj1.

; We now develop code for the second checksum algorithm, contributed by Jared
; Davis (now maintained by the ACL2 developers, who are responsible for any
; errors).  See also the long comment after check-sum-obj, below.

; Our initial attempts however were a problem for GCL, which boxes fixnums
; unless one is careful.  A regression took about 44 or 45 minutes instead of
; 35 or 36 minutes, which is really significant considering that (probably)
; only the checksum code was changed, and one would expect checksums to take a
; trivial fraction of time during a regression.  Therefore, we developed code
; to avoid boxing fixnums in GCL during a common operation: multiplication mod
; M31 = #x7fffffff.  The code below is developed only for defining that
; operation, times-mod-m31; so we could conditionalize with #+gcl all
; definitions below up to times-mod-m31.  We believe that the following is a
; theorem, but we have not proved it (nor even admitted the relevant functions
; into :logic mode):

; (implies (and (natp x) (< x #x7fffffff)
;               (natp y) (< y #x7fffffff))
;          (equal (times-mod-m31 x y)
;                 (rem (* x y) #x7fffffff)))

; We considered using our fancy times-mod-m31 and its subfunctions for other
; than GCL.  The time loss for ACL2h built on CCL 1.2 (actually
; 1.2-r10991M-trunk) on DarwinX8664 was only about 3.2%, which seems worth the
; cost in order to avoid having Lisp-specific code.  However, regression runs
; with ACL2 built on Allegro CL exhibited intermittent checksumming errors.  We
; wonder about a possible compiler bug, since neither heavy addition of checks,
; nor running with safety 3 (both ACL2h on CCL and ACL2 on Allegro CL) showed
; any inappropriate type declarations in the code below, and there were no
; checksumming problems exhibited with CCL, GCL, or SBCL.  Moreover, Allegro CL
; showed significant slow down with the fancy times-mod-m31, not surprisingly
; since Allegro CL supports fixnums of less than 32 bits (at the time this
; comment was written; many more bits now).  Therefore, we decided to use a
; much simpler times-mod-m31 for all Lisps except GCL.

(defun fchecksum-natural-aux (n ans)

; A "functional" checksum for natural numbers.
;
;   N is the natural number we want to checksum.
;   ANS is the answer we have accumulated so far.
;
; Let M31 be 2^31 - 1.  This happens to be the largest representable 32-bit
; signed number using 2's complement arithmetic.  It is also a Mersenne prime.
; Furthermore, let P1 be 392894102, which is a nice, large primitive root of
; M31.  From number theory, we can construct a basic pseudorandom number
; generator as follows:
;
;   rnd0 = seed
;   rnd1 = (rnd0 * P1) mod M31
;   rnd2 = (rnd1 * P1) mod M31
;   ...
;
; And our numbers will not repeat until 2^31 - 1.  In fact, such a generator
; is found in the community book "misc/random."
;
; Our checksum algorithm uses this idea in a slightly different way.  Given a
; 31-bit natural number, K, think of (K * P1) mod M31 as a way to "shuffle" the
; bits of K around in a fairly random manner.  Then, to checksum a (potentially
; large) integer n, we break n up into 31-bit chunks, call them K1, K2, ...,
; Km.  We then compute (Ki * P1) mod M31 for each i, and xor the results all
; together to compute a new, 31-bit checksum.

; A couple of other notes.
;
;  - M31 may be written as #x7FFFFFFF.
;
;  - We recur using (ash n -31), but this computes the same thing as (truncate
;    n (expt 2 31)).
;
;  - We split n into Ki by using (logand n #x7FFFFFFF), which is the same as
;    (rem n (expt 2 31)).

(defun symbol-class (sym wrld)

; The symbol-class of a symbol is one of three keywords:

; :program               - not defined within the logic
; :ideal                 - defined in the logic but not known to be CL compliant
; :common-lisp-compliant - defined in the logic and known to be compliant with
;                          Common Lisp

; Convention: We never print the symbol-classes to the user.  We would prefer
; the user not to think about these classes per se.  It encourages a certain
; confusion, we think, because users want everything to be
; common-lisp-compliant and start thinking of it as a mode, sort of like "super
; :logic" or something.  So we are keeping these names to ourselves by not
; using them in error messages and documentation.  Typically used English
; phrases are such and such is "compliant with Common Lisp" or "is not known to
; be compliant with Common Lisp."

; Historical Note: :Program function symbols were once called "red", :ideal
; symbols were once called "blue", and :common-lisp-compliant symbols were once
; called "gold."

; Before we describe the storage scheme, let us make a few observations.
; First, most function symbols have the :program symbol-class, because until
; ACL2 is admitted into the logic, the overwhelming majority of the function
; symbols will be system functions.  Second, all :logic function symbols have
; symbol-class :ideal or :common-lisp-compliant.  Third, this function,
; symbol-class, is most often applied to :logic function symbols, because most
; often we use it to sweep through the function symbols in a term before
; verify-guards.  Finally, theorem names are very rarely of interest here but
; they are always either :ideal or (very rarely) :common-lisp-compliant.

; Therefore, our storage scheme is that every :logic function will have a
; symbol-class property that is either :ideal or :common-lisp-compliant.  We
; will not store a symbol-class property for :program but just rely on the
; absence of the property (and the fact that the symbol is recognized as a
; function symbol) to default its symbol-class to :program.  Thus, system
; functions take no space but are slow to answer.  Finally, theorems will
; generally have no stored symbol-class (so it will default to :ideal for them)
; but when it is stored it will be :common-lisp-compliant.

; Note that the defun-mode of a symbol is actually determined by looking at its
; symbol-class.  We only store the symbol-class.  That is more often the
; property we need to look at.  But we believe it is simpler for the user to
; think in terms of :mode and :verify-guards.

; looser: fn can be a :program mode function symbol if fn is not built-in and
; normalp is nil.  But if fn is a built-in :program mode function symbol, we do
; not store even its 'unnormalized-body property; when we tried modifying
; defuns-fn-short-cut to store that property even when boot-strap-flg is true,
; we saw nearly a 9% increase in image size for SBCL, and nearly 13% for CCL.
; Consider using cltl-def-from-name or related functions if fn is in :program
; mode.

; The safe way to call this function is with normalp = nil, which yields the
; actual original body of fn.  The normalized body is provably equal to the
; unnormalized body, but that is not a strong enough property in some cases.
; Consider for example the following definition: (defun foo () (car 3)).  Then
; (body 'foo nil (w state)) is (CAR '3), so guard verification for foo will
; fail, as it should.  But (body 'foo t (w state)) is 'NIL, so we had better
; scan the unnormalized body when generating the guard conjecture rather than
; the normalized body.  Functional instantiation may also be problematic if
; constraints are gathered using the normalized body, although we do not yet
; have an example showing that this is critical.

; WARNING: If normalp is non-nil, then we are getting the most recent body
; installed by a :definition rule with non-nil :install-body value.  Be careful
; that this is really what is desired; and if so, be aware that we are not
; returning the corresponding def-body rune.

; to define the function def-body to find the most recent body that has 'equal
; as its :equal, rather than the recent body unconditionally.  But then, since
; we want :expand hints to use the latest body even if :equiv is not 'equal, we
; could have three different bodies in use at a given time (unnormalized,
; latest normalized, and latest normalized with :equiv = equal), and that just
; seems potentially too confusing.  Instead, our story will be that the body is
; always either the latest body or the (original) unnormalized body.

; defined to return (nth n st), then untranslate maps (nth n st) to (nth *ac*
; st).  The 'accessor-names property of st is actually used to carry this out.
; Update-nth and update-nth-array get similar such consideration to nth; see
; untranslate1.

; But how about, for example, (nth 0 (run st n)), where run returns a stobj st?
; Presumably we would like to print that as (nth *b* (run st n)) where b is the
; 0th field accessor function for st.  We would also like to handle terms such
; as (nth 1 (mv-nth 3 (run st n))).  These more general cases may be important
; for making stobj proofs palatable.  There is yet another consideration, which
; is that during proofs, the user may use variable names other than stobj names
; to refer to stobjs.  For example, there may be a theorem of the form (... st
; st0 ...), which could generate a term (nth n st0) during a proof that the
; user would prefer to see printed as (nth *b* st0).

; The present function attempts to return the accessor name to be used in place
; of n when untranslating (nth n term), (update-nth n val term), or
; (update-nth-array n key val term), with respect to the given world, wrld.

; Essay on Attachable Stobjs

; This Essay is derived from a proposal developed over time in the summer of
; 2024.  We thank Warren Hunt and Yahya Sohail for requesting a feature like
; attachable stobjs to support their work, as described in the next paragraph.
; We thank Warren, Sol Swords, and especially Yahya for feedback on this
; proposal (in particular, the name "attachable" was suggested by Yahya).

; Consider a certifiable book, say x86.lisp, that introduces an abstract stobj
; to represent the x86 state.  That book contains a child stobj, itself an
; abstract stobj, that models the memory.  This x86 book might also contain a
; number of theorems proved about the x86 stobj.  Yahya and Warren have posed
; the following challenge: allow, in different ACL2 sessions, different
; executable versions of the x86 stobj's memory -- without having to recertify
; x86.lisp, and without allocating significant space that will never be used.

; Part of our work in response to this request was to support the
; :non-executable keyword for abstract stobjs, not just concrete stobjs.
; Another part was to support switching a stobj between being global and not
; global -- that is, allow it to be added to the user-stobj-alist of state or
; removed from it.  This Essay is about a third part of our response, which
; evolved into the notion of "attachable stobj".

; Before reading further, it may be useful to see :DOC attach-stobj for much
; briefer discussion of attachable stobjs from a user perspective.  In
; particular, that topic notes that there are examples in
; books/system/tests/attachable-stobjs/.  However, this Essay is intended to be
; self-contained (in the usual sense for Essays in this source code, that is,
; assuming familiarity by the user of relevant background -- in this case,
; abstract stobjs and perhaps a general ability to navigate ACL2 source code).

; Section I begins with a brief summary, followed by more details in Section
; II.  Section III works out a tricky aspect involving compiled files.  Finally
; we show in Section IV how the proposal solves the original problem, followed
; by an appendix that gives further support for Section III.

; === I. Summary ===

; We allow an abstract stobj, abs, to have all aspects of its execution be
; overridden, including its foundation, by a previously introduced abstract
; stobj, impl.  This is accomplished by specifying (defabsstobj abs
; ... :attachable t ...) after having executed (attach-stobj abs impl),
; provided the logical functions of abs and impl suitably agree.  In this case,
; we call abs a "generic" or "attachable" stobj with "attachment" impl.  When
; :attachable is nil, the default), the new abstract stobj is an
; "implementation" stobj.

; The key idea is that when an attachable stobj abs is introduced with an
; implementation impl to be attached, abs should be viewed as having its
; execution-related fields -- in particular its :foundation and :exec values --
; replaced by those of impl.  Thus, abs may be viewed as an implementation
; stobj when it has an implementation attached.  Actually, abs can be attached
; to an attachable stobj whether or not abs is itself attachable.

; On the other hand, when a generic stobj abs does not have an attached
; implementation, as set up with attach-stobj, we may say that abs is "purely
; generic".

; === II. The Proposal (Modulo Details that Follow) ===

; We support :attachable t for a defabsstobj call, creating a so-called
; "attachable" or "generic" stobj, gen.  Gen may have another stobj "attached"
; to it, as described below; if not, then gen is "purely generic", and there is
; no functional effect of :attachable t (but compilation may be affected; see
; Section III below).  Any abstract stobj that is not purely generic is called
; an "implementation" stobj.  The event (attach-stobj gen impl) specifies that
; the implementation stobj impl may be attached to a generic (attachable) stobj
; gen that is introduced later.

; Attach-stobj generates a table event that stores the desired association.
; Thus, attach-stobj can be local, and it can be undone, like other events.
; The call (attach-stobj gen impl) is illegal after introducing gen.

; Before proceeding, we define the "logical skeleton" of a defabsstobj event as
; follows.  This is obtained by starting with the function specs (see :DOC
; defabsstobj) for keywords :recognizer, :creator, and :exports, then filling
; them in with defaults, and finally collecting their :LOGIC/:UPDATER pairs.

; Now consider an event (defabsstobj gen ... :attachable t ...) preceded by the
; event (attach-stobj gen impl).  This event is admissible if the usual
; requirements for a defabsstobj event hold, and moreover, the logical skeleton
; of this event corresponds to the logical skeleton of the defabsstobj event
; introducing impl (as discussed in :DOC attach-stobj and implemented in
; function absstobj-logical-skeleton-difference-msg).  In that case, the
; defabsstobj event for gen is effectively modified as followed.

; - The :foundation for gen is replaced by the :foundation for impl.
;
; - The function specs for gen -- that is, for the :recognizer, :creator, and
; :exports -- are replaced by the filled-in function specs for impl, except
; that in each case the name is preserved and the updater, if any, is replaced
; by the corresponding updater.  For example, if an export's function spec for
; gen with name FOO is FOO or (FOO ...), and the corresponding filled-in
; function spec for impl is (BAR :bar-key1 bar-val1 ...), then the function
; spec for gen with name FOO will effectively be (FOO :bar-key1 bar-val1 ....).
; Note that this doesn't change the values of keyword :logic, which are the
; same already between gen and impl (by the requirement on logical skeletons
; discussed above).

; - The values of :corr-fn, :congruent-to, and :protect-default for gen are
; replaced by those of impl.  Note that :corr-fn is not used by the
; implementation when a stobj is attached, but one can think of it as being
; present when considering why the event as modified is admissible.

; - The value of :non-executable for gen is left as is.

; Consider the case that an event (attach-stobj gen impl) is local.  Such an
; event might well be rather pointless in a book, so it seems unimportant to
; avoid the warning for this case, especially since the warning can be turned
; off.  Of greater concern is the fact that the subsequent defabsstobj event
; for gen will initially be based on impl, but later, when skipping proofs and
; local events, it will not (or it may even be based on an earlier, non-local
; attach-stobj event).  All necessary checks are done to ensure that this later
; evaluation of the defabsstobj event for gen is truly OK.

; As has been the case before an abstract stobj could be generic, a defabsstobj
; event is redundant when an identical such event is in the world.  There is no
; need to over-think redundancy; as long as necessary checks are made during
; include-book to ensure soundness regardless of whether or not a given event
; is skipped (which is the case for defabsstobj, as discussed above),
; redundancy can be any reasonable notion of when to ignore an event.

; === III. Avoiding Certain Compiled Code from Included Books ===

; This section describes a somewhat tricky problem and then presents the
; algorithm to be used for solving it.  The many examples in
; books/system/tests/attachable-stobjs/ may shed light on what is said below,
; in particular by executing the following forms for defstobj and defabsstobj
; events, respectively.

; (trace$ defstobj-raw-defs defstobj-axiomatic-defs)
; (trace$ defabsstobj-raw-defs defabsstobj-axiomatic-defs)

; The following sequence of steps exhibits what can go wrong if we are not
; careful to avoid certain compiled code.

; 1. Certify the book gen.lisp, which introduces a purely generic stobj, gen.

; 2. In a new ACL2 session, certify the book impl.lisp, which introduces the
; abstract stobj, impl, and contains the event (attach-stobj gen impl), but
; does not define gen.

; 3. In yet another ACL2 session, certify the "application" book app.lisp,
; which defines a function foo that takes the stobj gen as an argument.  We
; assume that app.lisp includes gen.lisp but does not define impl, so that gen
; can be provided different implementations by including a variety of books
; (one of which could be impl.lisp) before including app.lisp.

; 4. Evaluate the following sequence of events in a single ACL2 session.

; ; Introduce impl and establish that it is to be attached later to gen:
; (include-book "impl")
;
; ; Introduce gen; optional, since gen.lisp will be included by "app",below:
; (include-book "gen")
;
; ; Include an "application" book, which includes gen.lisp but not impl.lisp:
; (include-book "app")

; 5. Evaluate a call (foo gen ...).

; The intention is presumably that the evaluation of (foo gen ...) takes
; advantage of the attachment of impl to gen.  However, this might not happen
; with a naive implementation.  The reason is that the defun of foo was
; compiled when app.lisp was certified, at which time the original generic
; definition of gen was available but not its implementation.  So suppose that
; foo calls a primitive p of gen.  During certification of gen.lisp, p is a
; macro in Lisp -- abstract stobj primitives are always macros in raw Lisp --
; and its calls expand to calls of its generated :exec function, call it p_gen.
; So in the compiled file for the book app.lisp, the compiled code for foo is
; based on a call of p_gen as the expansion of each call of p.  No attempt to
; define gen in terms of impl will change that, since p was expanded away when
; creating this compiled code.  We had better not use that compiled code!
; (Normally we would, as per the Essay on Hash Table Support for Compilation.)

; Note that the user-stobj-alist is extended at the time an event is processed,
; not by loading the compiled file.  So the copy of gen in the user-stobj-alist
; is based on the :foundation of impl, not on the :foundation of gen.  An
; attempt to call p_gen on a copy of impl could be disastrous.

; It is not sufficient to fix this problem merely for functions that call a
; primitive of gen.  The compiler may inline a function called by foo, where
; that function calls p; so again, the compiled code for foo would be created
; by expanding a call of p to code based on p_gen.

; The Appendix shows files that provide a sort of simulation of this
; problem.

; Suppose we change "gen.lisp" to "gen-attached.lisp", to include "impl.lisp"
; before introducing gen, so that gen has attached implementation impl.  Even
; then, code in the compiled file for "gen.lisp" whose compilation involves
; gen's primitives must be ignored, regardless of whether those primitives are
; defined merely using gen or also taking impl into account.  Now suppose that
; in a new ACL2 session we evaluate the following sequence of events, where the
; book "impl2.lisp" defines stobj impl2 followed by event (attach-stobj gen
; impl2).

; (include-book "impl")
; (include-book "impl2")
; (attach-stobj gen impl2)
; (include-book "gen-attached")

; Then the form (include-book "impl") in "gen-attached.lisp" will be redundant;
; so impl2, not impl, will be attached to gen.  The compilation of code for the
; primitives of gen will do macroexpansion without taking into account the
; attachment of impl2, so we have the same problem as before.
;
; We have seen above that compiled code from books must be ignored when it is
; based on macroexpanding generic stobj primitives.  Thus, suppose that ACL2 is
; processing a defun event for a function symbol, foo, whose code thus depends
; on generic stobj primitive p.  (This includes not just the body, but also the
; guard; we say more about guards below.)  We want to avoid the precompiled
; symbol-function for foo, whether foo calls p directly or instead foo invokes
; a chain of inlined functions ending with a call of p.  Now suppose a
; function, bar, is introduced later and calls foo.  This problem does not
; invalidate the precompiled symbol-function for bar, provided foo is
; proclaimed notinline before compiling bar (so that the call of p made by foo
; is not macroexpanded when compiling bar).
;
; We thus introduce two categories of function symbols that together are
; intended to include all ACL2 function symbols that should not be called by
; code obtained from a book's compiled file.  First, we define an "extended
; generic" function to be a user-defined function symbol whose translated guard
; or body contains a call of a generic stobj primitive or, recursively, a call
; of an inlined function -- one whose symbol-name ends in "$INLINE" -- that is
; an extended generic.  Second, we define an "extended-generic barrier"
; function to be a user-defined function symbol that is not inlined, whose
; translated guard or body calls an extended-generic function.  (The
; restrictions to user-defined functions is actually no restriction at all,
; because there are no built-in generic stobjs.)

; Add-trip will refuse to use a book's precompiled code for a function that is
; an extended generic or an extended-generic barrier.  Also, every
; extended-generic barrier will be proclaimed notinline; more on that below.

; For each such notinline function, the corresponding *1* function is also
; proclaimed notinline.  It is necessary to do this for *1* functions, if for
; no other reason than that the *1* function for an extended-generic barrier F
; can call a stobj primitive called in the guard for F.  Because of that
; observation and because of mbe and ec-call, we feel justified simply to treat
; the *1* function for a function F just as we treat F, for purposes of
; proclaiming notinline and for having add-trip avoid precompiled code.  This
; treatment of *1* functions also has the advantage of simplicity, as opposed
; to teasing apart cases where we might treat *1* functions differently.

; With that simplicity in mind, we consider all :logic or :exec functions (for
; mbe, and also for abstract stobj primitives although for those the defun
; events take care of the :logic functions), and we consider not only bodies
; but also guards of defun forms, when determining whether a function symbol is
; an extended generic or an extended-generic barrier.

; We now describe an algorithm, as promised above, for determining extended
; generics and extended-generic barriers.  Two respective world globals are
; maintained, ext-gens and ext-gen-barriers.  These are both initially nil and
; are extended by the events that introduce new function symbols: defun,
; defstobj, and defabsstobj.  First consider defstobj: it extends those globals
; by way of the defun events that they generate (and we'll discuss defun last),
; and that is sufficient (as the raw Lisp code uses only function symbols
; appearing in those defuns).  Second, consider defabsstobj.  Note that the
; primitives are macros in raw Lisp.  The two globals are extended according to
; two cases.  For a generic stobj, each of its primitives is added to ext-gens.
; Otherwise, the primitives added are those whose :exec function is in
; ext-gens.  (The *1* functions for the primitives need to be dealt with as
; well, as discussed earlier.  But defun events for the primitives call their
; :logic functions and guards, so these defuns will extend the two globals to
; cover their :logic functions and guards.)  Finally consider a defun event for
; function F whose guard or body calls a function in ext-gens; then there are
; two cases.  (We could skip this if F is non-executable, since then the
; compiled definitions for F and *1*F are fine -- they just cause an error.
; But we have chosen to keep it simple and not bother with this exception, both
; for simplicity and in case some day ACL2 provides a way to remove or ignore
; non-executability, at least for *1*F.)  If F is a user-defined inlined
; function -- i.e., the symbol-name ends in "$INLINE" -- then F is added to
; ext-gens.  Otherwise F is added to ext-gen-barriers.

; Let us address what might seem like a hole in the algorithm above.  Suppose
; that st is a generic stobj that is a field of a concrete stobj, for example
; as follows.  In the discussion below, the presence or absence of keyword
; value :inline t makes no difference.

;   (defstobj top1
;     (st1 :type st))
;     :inline t ; optional
;     )

; It may seem unfortunate that st1 is in neither ext-gen-barriers nor ext-gen,
; if one is concerned about compiled calls of st1 made by subsequently defined
; functions.  However, (st1 top1) is defined to be (svref top1 0) in raw Lisp.
; Moreover, st1 is never called in ACL2 code except by way of stobj-let, in
; which case there will be a call of a stobj primitive for st, which thus will
; be in ext-gens.  Thus it does not matter that st1 is in neither
; ext-gen-barriers nor ext-gen, because any call of st1 in the body or guard of
; a subsequent defun will result in marking the function being defined as being
; in ext-gen or ext-gen-barriers (by virtue of an st primitive).

; We have seen a benefit, above, from the following fact: the use of stobj-let,
; on an attachable stobj field of a stobj, triggers inclusion in ext-gens or
; ext-gen-barriers of the function being defined (because of the call of a
; child stobj primitive).  That fact provides another benefit.  The use of
; memoize-flush should be based on the congruent stobj representative for the
; stobj attached to gen, not gen itself.  The call of congruent-stobj-rep-raw
; in the definition of stobj-let-fn-raw could get the wrong result in raw Lisp
; code, from a book's compiled file, for a function whose body calls stobj-let.
; However, that wrong result is not used because that code is skipped, thanks
; to inclusion of that function in ext-gens or ext-gen-barriers.  See also a
; comment above the call of congruent-stobj-rep-raw in the definition of
; stobj-let-fn-raw.

; Before a book's expansion file is compiled, each function called in the book
; that is in ext-gen-barriers is proclaimed notinline.  This is carried out
; by function install-defs-for-add-trip, which is called in add-trip, which
; has processed any such function by the point compilation is invoked.

; When add-trip is processing an ACL2 function symbol F or its *1* function, it
; will skip hash-table lookup to obtain the symbol-function if F is in ext-gens
; or ext-gen-barriers.  Note that if F is an abstract stobj primitive, then F
; is an ACL2 function but F is a raw Lisp macro, so for F we will avoid looking
; up the macro-function for F, but for *1*F it will still be the
; symbol-function that is not looked up.

; (Technical detail: Why not take similar care for ACL2 constants and macros?
; The use of stobj primitives would have to be by way of with-local-stobj in
; these cases.  However, with-local-stobj is illegal in a defconst form, and it
; is an error to invoke with-local-stobj during macroexpansion.)

; An induction on the world establishes that no function suffers from the
; problem identified in this section, of having compiled code that depends on a
; generic stobj primitive that has been superseded using an :exec functions
; from an implementation stobj.  Suppose in particular that add-trip is
; handling a new function symbol F introduced by defun or defstobj that could
; call a primitive for a generic stobj, the concern being that compiled code
; for the function is somehow based on the generic (unattached) version of that
; primitive.  A sequence of calls from the new function to the primitive would
; clearly need to include a function symbol (possibly the new one itself) in
; one of the two new world globals, ext-gens or ext-gen-barriers.  So either
; add-trip would avoid the pre-compiled code for F, or else every such path of
; calls would go through an existing function proclaimed notinline, whose code
; is correct by the inductive hypothesis.  The argument is similar for
; defabsstobj.

; When a pre-compiled symbol-function is avoided, the resulting symbol-function
; might consist of interpreted code, not compiled code, if the Lisp is other
; than SBCL or CCL.  ACL2 will compile the definition in this case -- the
; hash-table lookup will be used only to decide whether to compile, according
; to whether the looked-up function is compiled.  If that compilation turns out
; to be inconveniently slow for the user, we could avoid it and instead just
; document that users may want to compile such functions, though we should
; perhaps then issue a warning or observation when this case is encountered.

; (Remark.  Instead of dealing with this issue by using two world globals,
; ext-gens and ext-gen-barriers, we could use a new property that could take
; any of three values: nil, 'extended-generic, or 'extended-generic-barrier.
; That approach would avoid the risk of slowdown when the two existing globals
; have values that are very long lists.  On the other hand, repeated property
; list lookup might well be more expensive in practice.  If we adopt this
; alternate approach then as an optimization, we may still maintain a world
; global to indicate whether any such property has been set, so that if not, we
; can avoid looking at those properties.)

; (Remark. A drawback to this proposal is that once a function symbol is
; proclaimed notinline, Common Lisp provides no way to undo that proclaim form
; other than to proclaim the symbol inline.  So if an encapsulate locally
; includes a book where F is proclaimed notinline, and after the encapsulate a
; different function is defined that also is named F, the new one will also be
; treated as notinline by the compiler (unless subsequently proclaimed inline
; somehow) during that ACL2 session.  This seems to be a small price to pay,
; since probably rather few functions are automatically inlined by a compiler,
; and an ACL2 user who really cares for a function to be inlined can use
; defun-inline (or directly provide an "$INLINE" suffix).

; (Remark.  The discussion above suggests that add-trip should avoid using a
; hash table that was created during an early load of a compiled file, for
; obtaining a symbol-function for a symbol in world globals ext-gens or
; ext-gen-barriers.  That restriction could be avoided when for a function
; symbol whose relevant generic stobjs all have no attachments.  But that
; optimization may add considerable complexity and may not often apply anyhow,
; so we don't do it.)

; === IV. An Application ===

; This section shows how the proposal above can solve the original problem.
; Thus, it supports including a single certified book ("x86 book") that
; introduces the x86 abstract stobj, but with a choice of executable memory
; model for each ACL2 session -- efficiently and without recertifying the x86
; book.

; First let's review the current x86 stobj.  It looks as follows (as of
; mid-August 2024).

; (DEFABSSTOBJ X86
;  :FOUNDATION X86$C
;  ...
;  (MEMI :LOGIC MEMI$A :EXEC READ-MEM$C)
;  ...)

; Here's its foundation.

; (DEFSTOBJ X86$C
;  ...
;  (MEM$C :TYPE BIGMEM::MEM)
;  ...)

; And here is the memory model, realized as an abstract stobj that is the type
; of mem$c as noted just above.

; (DEFABSSTOBJ BIGMEM::MEM
;  :FOUNDATION BIGMEM::MEM$C
;  ...
;  :EXPORTS
;  ((BIGMEM::READ-MEM
;           :LOGIC BIGMEM::READ-MEM$A
;           :EXEC BIGMEM::READ-MEM$C
;           :CORRESPONDENCE BIGMEM::READ-MEM{CORRESPONDENCE}
;           :GUARD-THM BIGMEM::READ-MEM{GUARD-THM})
;   (BIGMEM::WRITE-MEM
;           :LOGIC BIGMEM::WRITE-MEM$A
;           :EXEC BIGMEM::WRITE-MEM$C
;           :CORRESPONDENCE BIGMEM::WRITE-MEM{CORRESPONDENCE}
;           :GUARD-THM BIGMEM::WRITE-MEM{GUARD-THM})))

; Here is the foundation for the abstract stobj just above.

; (DEFSTOBJ BIGMEM::MEM$C
;   (BIGMEM::LEVEL1 :TYPE (ARRAY BIGMEM::L1 (4194304))
;                   :RESIZABLE NIL)
;   :INLINE T
;   :NON-MEMOIZABLE T)

; For the revised x86 stobj we would modify bigmem::mem to be a generic stobj.
; We also would make it non-global since we don't plan to use a global copy --
; it will only be instantiated as a part of the x86 stobj.  So in (DEFABSSTOBJ
; BIGMEM::MEM ...), we would add keyword values :ATTACHABLE T and
; :NON-EXECUTABLE T.

; We can view the resulting bigmem::mem as the default memory model for the x86
; stobj.  If we want a different memory model, say mem2, we can first include a
; book that contains the event
; (DEFABSSTOBJ MEM2 ...)
; where mem2 has the same logical skeleton as bigmem::mem, followed by the
; event
; (ATTACH-STOBJ BIGMEM::MEM MEM2).

; Of course, by appropriate use of the keyword value :non-executable t for
; defabsstobj together with add-global-stobj, we can avoid allocating memory
; until we need it.

; === Appendix: More about Including Books Without Compiled Files ===

; Here are the files promised by Section III.  The last, script.lsp, explains
; how to use the two certifiable books shown above it, absstobj-simple.lisp and
; foo.lisp, to illustrate the issue.  The first of these is a simpler version
; of community book demos/defabsstobj-example-1.lisp.

; The idea here is for a book, absstobj-simple.lisp, to introduce an abstract
; stobj, st, with an export, misc, whose :exec function causes an error.  After
; certifying that book, we might wish to include it in an environment where the
; :exec function of misc does not cause an error, in analogy to including a
; book with an implementation stobj before including the book with the
; corresponding abstract stobj (whose role is played by st).  Below, it is
; shown that this doesn't work: the error still in an application book
; (foo.lisp) even after modifying the :exec function to avoid causing an error,
; unless the application book is included with :load-compiled-file nil.
